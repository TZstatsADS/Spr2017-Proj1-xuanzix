### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: What Do Inauguration Speeches Tell Us?
+ This project is conducted by [Xuanzi Xu]

+ Project summary: [In this project, I analyze the US President speeches in terms of the sentence length, the total words, the total vocabulary and so on. Meanwhile, I applied the word cloud to several speeches to demonstrate the change of the speech topic as time goes on. Also, considering the politic background and personal character, I illustrated the reason of such outputs. Finally, using sentiment analysis package, I analyzed the sentimental oscillation of different Presidents during the whole process of speech, also explained it in terms of the situations of economy, politics and etc.]
